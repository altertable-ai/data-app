# Compose an exploration

Define the question, population, period, measures, and comparison before choosing
widgets. A focused answer may need only a chart and a paragraph.

## Build a sequence of questions

Lead with the strongest supported result and visible scope. Give each section a
question: what happened, when, where it differs, or what supports the finding.
Omit sections that add no evidence.

| Element   | Purpose                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Metric    | Establish magnitude or change                          |
| Chart     | Reveal the pattern that answers the section's question |
| Narrative | Interpret, qualify, or suggest the next comparison     |
| Table     | Support exact comparisons and inspection               |
| Filter    | Test a hypothesis or change scope                      |

Place explanations beside their evidence. Use [layout primitives](layout.md)
for reading order and peer comparisons, and [choose charts](widgets.md#choose-a-visualization)
by the question they answer. Use app tabs for distinct questions and widget
`views` for alternate representations of one dataset.

## Keep comparisons consistent

Choose useful filter defaults with adequate coverage. Keep related metrics,
charts, and prose consistent in population, definitions, units, and periods;
explain deliberate differences. Show counts alongside rates when sample size
matters. Compute overall rates from numerators and denominators rather than
averaging subgroup rates.

Derive claims from the [displayed result and its input](views.md#preserve-displayed-results).
A claim about all channels may stop being valid after selecting one. Observed
differences support investigation; they do not establish a cause.

## Example: where are we losing signups?

Define funnel entry, completion window, and channel attribution. Compare
populations with equal opportunity to complete and identify incomplete periods.

| Question                              | Display                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| How many starters complete?           | Conversion versus a comparable prior period, with counts |
| When does conversion change?          | Trend with incomplete periods identified                 |
| At which step and for which channels? | Funnel and channel comparisons with counts and rates     |
| What supports the comparison?         | Table of counts, denominators, and rates                 |

Use one view for these related datasets. Let dates select funnel entry dates and
channel filters affect every section. Reuse datasets for charts and tables.
Select one to four supported findings for the [story](stories-and-export.md).
Verify that changing a filter updates every claim and preserves a useful reading
order on phones.
